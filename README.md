# React Styleguide

A client side living styleguide.

This is very much a work in progress, based totally on this demo: [https://github.com/css-modules/webpack-demo](https://github.com/css-modules/webpack-demo)

## Technologies

The styleguide was built using:

* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
* [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io)

## Run the app

```bash
npm install
npm start & open http://localhost:8080
```
